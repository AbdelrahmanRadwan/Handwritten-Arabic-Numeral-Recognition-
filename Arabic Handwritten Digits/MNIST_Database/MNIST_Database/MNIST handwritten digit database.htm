<CENTER>MNIST handwritten digit database</CENTER>
<P><FONT face=Arial,Helvetica><FONT size=+0>The MNIST database of handwritten 
digits, available on this site, has a training set of 60,000 examples. It is a 
subset of a larger set available from NIST.&nbsp; The digits have been 
size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image. 
<P>It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and 
pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on 
preprocessing and formatting. 
<P>Two files are available in the AFS assignment directory:

<H2>Warning: Netscape doesn't typically download these files correctly. You will 
need to copy them directly using AFS.

<P>The original black and white (bilevel) images from NIST were size normalized 
to fit in a 20x20 pixel box while preserving their aspect ratio. The resulting 
images contain grey levels as a result of the anti-aliasing technique used by 
the normalization algorithm. the images were centered in a 28x28 image by 
computing the center of mass of the pixels, and translating the image so as to 
position this point at the center of the 28x28 field. 
<P>The MNIST database was constructed from NIST's Special Database 3 and Special 
Database 1 which contain binary images of handwritten digits. NIST originally 
designated SD-3 as their training set and SD-1 as their test set. However, SD-3 
is much cleaner and easier to recognize than SD-1. The reason for this can be 
found on the fact that SD-3 was collected among Census Bureau employees, while 
SD-1 was collected among high-school students. Drawing sensible conclusions from 
learning experiments requires that the result be independent of the choice of 
training set and test among the complete set of samples. Therefore it was 
necessary to build a new database by mixing NIST's datasets. 
<P>The MNIST training set is composed of 30,000 patterns from SD-3 and 30,000 
patterns from SD-1. Our test set was composed of 5,000 patterns from SD-3 and 
5,000 patterns from SD-1. The 60,000 pattern training set contained examples 
from approximately 250 writers. We made sure that the sets of writers of the 
training set and test set were disjoint. 
<P>SD-1 contains 58,527 digit images written by 500 different writers. In 
contrast to SD-3, where blocks of data from each writer appeared in sequence, 
the data in SD-1 is scrambled. Writer identities for SD-1 is available and we 
used this information to unscramble the writers. We then split SD-1 in two: 
characters written by the first 250 writers went into our new training set. The 
remaining 250 writers were placed in our test set. Thus we had two sets with 
nearly 30,000 examples each. The new training set was completed with enough 
examples from SD-3, starting at pattern # 0, to make a full set of 60,000 
training patterns. Similarly, the new test set was completed with SD-3 examples 
starting at pattern # 35,000 to make a full set with 60,000 test patterns. Only 
a subset of 10,000 test images (5,000 from SD-1 and 5,000 from SD-3) is 
available on this site. The full 60,000 sample training set is available. 
<H2><FONT color=#3333ff>FILE FORMATS FOR THE MNIST DATABASE</FONT></H2>The data 
is stored in a very simple file format designed for storing vectors and 
multidimensional matrices. General info on this format is given at the end of 
this page, but you don't need to read that to use the data files. 
<P>All the integers in the files are stored in the MSB first (high endian) 
format used by most non-Intel processors. Users of Intel processors and other 
low-endian machines must flip the bytes of the header. 
<P>There are 2 files:<TT></TT> 
<P><TT>train-images-idx3-ubyte: training set images</TT> 
<BR><TT>train-labels-idx1-ubyte: training set labels</TT> 
<P>The training set contains 60000 examples. 
<P>The first 5000 examples of the test set are taken from the original NIST 
training set. The last 5000 are taken from the original NIST test set. The first 
5000 are cleaner and easier than the last 5000.
